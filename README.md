# Test Rfh

The scope of this repo is to be the playground to check how the `rfh` tool could be used in order to automate all those kind of actions that normally should be applied to a given rfh repo.

In particular it will be tested how the `rfh` can be used inside the GH actions to run when some changes happens to the `conf/input` file.
